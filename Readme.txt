                   WHAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS ALL ABOUT

     Software development is the process of designing,programming,documenting, testing, and bug fixing 
involved in creating and maintaining applications,frameworks,or other software components.

                TYPES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
1. Web Development
    Web development today is exploding thanks to the emergence of new web technologies and Application Programming
    Interface (APIs) which let websites "plug in" to other useful features.
       What you need to know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, PHP, Python e.t.c.

2. Mobile Development    
     Mobile Development could better be described as "App Development" and involves creating applications that run on Mobile
     phones. Such as: iPhones, Android devices.  
        What you need to know: Android, Swift(for iOS), Java, c#

3. Data Science
    It's actually what and how machines think. Machines need large amounts of data to "learn" from in 
    order 'to make their own decisions' and given situations, and data Science ensures this data is 
    presented in the current form.
       What you need to know: C/C++, Python    

4. Application Development
     These are standard applications that perform their duties on traditional desktop operating system
     Such as Windows, Mac or Linux
       What you need to know: Java, C/C++, C#, Python

5. Back-end Development
    The back-end or server side, of a website is where the data is stored and it usually consists of three 
    parts: a server, an application, and a database.
       What you need to know: Python, Java, C/C++, (my)SQL

6. API Development
    API development is the art of building something extensible

7. Cloud Computing
    It use networks of remote servers hosted on the internet to store and manage data rather than using a 
    personal computer or local host.


                     DUTIES OF A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
  Software developers typically do the following :
1. Analyze users’ needs and then design, test, and develop software to meet those needs
2. Recommend software upgrades for customers’ existing programs and systems
3. Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together
4. Create a variety of models and diagrams (such as flowcharts) that show programmers the software code needed for an application
5. Ensure that a program continues to function normally through software maintenance and testing
6. Document every aspect of an application or system as a reference for future maintenance and upgrades
7. Collaborate with other computer specialists to create optimum software
